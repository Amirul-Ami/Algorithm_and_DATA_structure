# Algorithm -> *clear problem statement

  i) Algorithm is sets of problem that solves that problems
 ii) Algorithm definition must contain specific set of instruction in a particular order, we really need to be clear about the order and which these instruction are executed.
iii) Each step in our algorithm definition is not be a complex one and need to be explicitly clear.
 iv) Algorithm should produce a result.
  v) Algorithm should actually complete and not take an infinite amount of time

# Problem solving guidelines ->  ** Brekdown the problem into any possible number of small problems,
                                         where each problem clearly define INPUTS and OUTPUTS.
