What is a Data Structure?
A data structure (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be sue effectively.

Why Data Structure?
@ They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
@ They help to manage and organize data.
@ They make code cleaner and easier to understand.
 

Abstract Data type:
@ An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.
The interface does not give any specific detail about how something implemented or in what programming language.
example: 
(suppose that your abstraction data type is for a mode of transportation to get from point A to point B. as we both know there are many modes of transportation to get from one place to another. So which one do you choose?)
Some specific modes of transportation might be walking or biking, perhaps even taking a train and so on, these specific modes of transportation would be analogous to the data structure themselves.
We want to get from one place to another through some mode of transportation, that was our Abstract data type.
How did we do that exactly?
: “That is the data structure.”

Some example of abstraction data type:
	
Abstraction (ADT)	        Implementation (DS)
----------------------------------------------
List	                      Dynamic Array
                            Linked List

Queue	                Linked List based Queue
                          Array based Queue
                          Stack base Queue

Map	                        Tree Map
                      Hash Map/ Hash Table

                          Bicycle
